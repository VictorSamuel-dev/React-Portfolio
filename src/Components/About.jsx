            My Journey started with a Bachelor's in Finance, which landed me a job at verious orginization I've been very fortunate to work for. This aligned perfectly with the original plan, but after starting at Vercel, I quickly found myself much more interestd in the work that my colleagues in software teams were doing. After researching the posibility of a career transition, I decided to bravely abandon my stable career in accounting and finance and dive deep into software development in the hope of eventually landing a job in tech. While I did not have a formal academic background in computer science or software development, I have always been fascinated by technology and saw programming as a means for problem solving and creative expression. Bootcamp was a lot to take in, but I enjoyed the challenges it posed and the learning opportunity it presented. By the end of the bookcamp, I had learned a lot of the fundamentals of JavaScript, and developed the ability to solve complex problems by asking the right questions and researching solutions. The prospect of constantly learning and growing while solving problems in creative ways piqued my interest and provided me the motivation required to purse the challenging endeavour of a career transition.
