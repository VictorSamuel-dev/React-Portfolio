Using Tailwind component libraries, Vite, postcss to bring forth the front end look while ensuring the data are stored on the local servicer. When you click on the navigations you are taken to their respective section, when you click download resume, you are provided with a pdf version of my outline work section, and in the portfolio section you are taken to the respective github and deployed links.
